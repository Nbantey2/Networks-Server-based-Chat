Server
    Socket setup and creation is currently handled
    server listens for messages on socket then receives them as objects:
        'header': [header],
        'data': [data]
    
    Core loop:
        Read all sockets into read_sockets and exception_sockets

        for each read_socket that is a notified_socket
            if it's a server socket (a new connection)
                accept it and add it to the client list
            if it's not (meaning it's a message from an existing connection)
                process the message using receive_message
                if the message is false
                    close the connection gracefully
                    drop the client from the client list
                else (if the message is anything other than disconnect)
                    get the client id by checking the client list for the socket
                    iterate over all clients
                        if the client isn't the sender, send them the message
                        and the sender

Current bugs: This works, but doesn't push to the client. That is, the client 
has to send a message to get a message from the server. How do we make it
