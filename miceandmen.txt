Grading:
25% - "Connection phase" (encryption stuff and handshaking)
35% - "Chat phase" (starting chats between users, chatting and 
		    ending chats. Also maybe message logging?)
group report - 40%

Need to implement client ids
	On first run (that is, if there isn't a user id file present):
		client gets username from user and tries to connect with that username
		if successful the server will send back a user id
		the client saves the id in a file
		the server tells the client it's logged in
	On subsequent runs
		the client gets its user id from the file and sends it to the server	
		the server tells the client it's logged in

client talking with at most one other client

sockets are the important bit

Entire encryption flow may be out of scope at this point, but if not:
	<encryption handshake stuff>

Chat Phase:
	After connecting a user can say [chat (user)] to start chatting
	with another user
	if the target user is offline or involved in another chat this fails
		server sends a failure response
		client prints (username) was unavailable or somesuch
	if the target user is online and not in another chat
		server acnkowledges that they're both available and sends them a protocol message
		to say chat started
		clients print that the chat has started

		from this point, any message the users send OTHER THAN THE OPTION BELOW is interpreted as
		a message to the other user
			the client encodes the message and sends it to the server
			the server receives it, logs it*, and sends it to the other client
			Repeat this until..
		If either client sends the message "End Chat"
			the server receives it and sends and end-of-chat protocol message to both clients
			the clients receive this and prints it, waits for the client to hit enter, then
			exits the chat mode

ONCE WE GET THE ABOVE FLOW WORKING PROPERLY:
	take an hour or so break for food and decompression
	evaluate if we have enough time to implement chat history OR encryption, I think both is
	unlikely to be completed.

We also need to keep in mind the group and individual reports
